# MeetRobot Foundation: Values & Principles

## What We Do

We help people train humanoid robots to be useful in their communities—not for corporate profit, but for the common good. Whether it's helping in senior centers, schools, or community spaces, these robots learn from real people doing real work.

## How It Works

Anyone can start a local MeetRobot node with just one robot and a passion for helping their community. You teach the robot through hands-on interaction (no programming required—AI tools help with the technical stuff). Everything you learn gets shared openly so other communities can benefit.

Think of it like teaching a very eager, very clumsy intern—except this intern never gets tired, can be copied infinitely, and everything it learns can be shared with robots around the world.

## Why We're Different

Most robot companies train their machines behind closed doors, optimizing for speed and profit. We train ours in public, optimizing for human dignity. The data stays open, the methods stay transparent, and the results belong to everyone.

## Our Core Principles

### How we train robots:
→ **Robots should be trained by the people they serve, not the companies that profit from them**

→ **The best training data comes from diverse communities with diverse needs**

→ **Every local node improves the global network—your robot's lessons help everyone's robots**

### How we stay open:
→ **All our code, methods, and finances are public (only passwords and personal info stay private)**

→ **Anyone can copy our approach and start their own node—that's the goal, not a threat**

→ **We curate what becomes the "official" MeetRobot methodology based on quality and values**

### How we stay accessible:
→ **One person with one robot is enough to begin**

→ **AI tools handle the technical complexity—you don't need to be a programmer**

→ **If running a node requires a team or bureaucracy, we've made it too complicated**

## The Complete Nine Principles

For reference, here are all nine principles in their original form:

1. **Robots should be trained by the people they serve, not the companies that profit from them.**

2. **This work belongs to everyone, so everyone can build it.**

3. **One person, one robot is all you need to start. If you can't run it solo, it's too complicated.**

4. **The network scales through replication, not coordination.**

5. **Anyone can fork and experiment. We curate what becomes canonical based on quality and values alignment.**

6. **Everything lives in GitHub. Our finances are a public ledger. Only passwords and PII stay private.**

7. **AI agents make the technical accessible. You don't need to be a programmer to contribute.**

8. **Every node improves the whole. Every dataset makes the next robot smarter.**

9. **The best training data comes from the communities being served. Real diversity requires real diversity in trainers.**

## Where We Are Now (2025)

**Let's be honest:** Humanoid robots are brand new, clumsy, and not ready for everything you see in sci-fi movies. They're more "enthusiastic toddler" than "helpful assistant."

**Our current reality:**
- Safety first, always - we're developing protocols as we go
- We're figuring out safe interaction methods together as a community
- Progress is slow, mistakes happen, learning is public
- This is ground-floor stuff - early experiments, careful steps

**Why we're transparent about this:**

Companies hide limitations until products are polished. We show you the messy middle because that's where the learning happens. If you want to see a robot perfectly pour coffee, wait 5 years and buy a commercial model. If you want to help figure out how robots can be safely useful, join us now.

## Why We're a Nonprofit

These aren't business decisions. They're principles for building technology worth trusting.

**When you support MeetRobot Foundation, you're supporting:**
- Community-driven training principles
- Radical transparency in robotics
- Open methodology that anyone can audit

We don't control—and don't endorse—every fork or use case. That's by design. We believe the principles themselves filter for human-flourishing applications.
